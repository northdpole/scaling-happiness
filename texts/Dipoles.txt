Since we are using a circular accelerator, we have to make sure that the particles does not hit it's sides, and are guided correctly from one side to the other. We do that with a strong magnetic field maintained by superconducting electromagnets. 

Dipole magnets, one of the most complex parts of the LHC, are used to bend the paths of the particles. There are 1232 main dipoles, each 15 metres long and weighing in at 35 tonnes. If normal magnets were used in the 27 km-long LHC instead of superconducting magnets, the accelerator would have to be 120 kilometres long to reach the same energy. Powerful magnetic fields generated by the dipole magnets allow the beam to handle tighter turns.

The electromagnets are built from coils of special electric cable that operates in a superconducting state, efficiently conducting electricity without resistance or loss of energy. This requires chilling the magnets to ‑271.3°C – a temperature colder than outer space. For this reason, much of the accelerator is connected to a distribution system of liquid helium, which cools the magnets, as well as to other supply services.

The main dipoles that are used to bend the beam was a serious technological challenge.
